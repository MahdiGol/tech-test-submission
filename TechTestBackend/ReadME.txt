How did you verify that everything works correctly?

    I manually tested the application by inputting various user identifiers and verified that the correct image URL is returned based on the rules.
    I wrote unit tests to verify the logic in the AvatarController, testing various cases (e.g., last digit, vowels, non-alphanumeric characters).
    Used Postman to verify the API endpoint independently from the frontend.

How long did it take you to complete the task?

    The task took approximately 2 hours .

What else could be done to your solution to make it ready for production?

    Error handling: Add more robust error handling to manage cases like unavailable external APIs or database failures.
    Rate limiting and caching: Implement rate limiting and caching for external API calls (like the JSON server and Dicebear API) to improve performance.
    Input validation and security: Validate and sanitize the user identifier to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or input tampering.
    Logging and monitoring: Add logging for better traceability and monitoring of the service in a production environment.
    Scalability: Deploy the service to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS) and set up auto-scaling to handle increased traffic.
    Testing: Write more extensive tests, including integration tests, to ensure the application functions correctly end-to-end.
